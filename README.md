<h1 align="center">What is the Metaverse?</h1>

<p>Imagine a virtual world where billions of people live, work, shop, learn and interact with each other -- all from the comfort of their couches in the physical world.
  
  
  
  <br>
  

In this world, the computer screens we use today to connect to a worldwide web of information have become portals to a 3D virtual realm that's palpable -- like real life, only bigger and better. Digital facsimiles of ourselves, or avatars, move freely from one experience to another, taking our identities and our money with us.</p>


<br>


<p>This project is a part of my learning journey. It is a Modern, fully responsive landing page of the Metaverse titled as "Metaversus". It includes the proper implementation of the following tech stack:</p>


<br>


<ul>
  <li>NextJS 13</li>
  <li>Framer Motion</li>
  <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
</ul>
